# Mini Lisp Repl

## Intro

## Goals

To implement a minimal Lisp Read-Eval-Print-Loop. There are only a few
keywords used in this implementation.

* atom
* lambda
* '
* =
* cond
* cons
* car
* cdr

Along with these keywords I am adding a few elementary operators for use with
mathematical programs.

* \+
* \-
* \*
* \/
* %
